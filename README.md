# mockobservation_tools

These are tools I have created to aid in my research of Galaxy Simulations. Several of the tools are made to create mock images from the FIRE simulations and measure them using observation techniques, like Sersic Profiles Fiting. 

Several of the tools in galaxy_tools make use or are adapted from FIRE studio, a code created by Alex Gurvich https://ascl.net/2202.006
Please use my version of FIRE_studio, as I can ensure it is compatable with my mockobservation_tools:

Git clone both FIRE_studio and mockobservation_tools
In the cloned files you can install the packages using:
pip instal .
